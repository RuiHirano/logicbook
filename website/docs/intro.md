# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Logicbook in less than 5 minutes**.

## Install

```

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new logicbook**.

### What you'll need

## Generate a new logicbook site

Generate a new Logicbook site using the **logicbook command**.

```bash
cd your-python-project
logicbook init
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Logicbook.
